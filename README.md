# Pyramidal-horn-antenna-at-2GHz-using-Ansys-HFSS
Pyramidal horn is one type of aperture antenna flared in both directions, a combination of E-plane 

and H-plane horns. 3D figure is shown as below. Horn antennas are commonly used as a standard 

gain antenna for calibration purpose of other antennas. Horn antennas are also used as a feeding 

element for large reflector and lens antennas in communication systems. Its radiation pattern in 

one plane can be adjusted by changing the aperture dimensions or length of the horn in that plane 

with negligible variations in the radiation pattern in another plane. By proper selection of the 

feeding element, a wideband horn antenna has been reported. A pyramidal horn antenna is a type 

of directional antenna characterized by its flaring, pyramid-like shape and rectangular crosssection. It is an evolution of a waveguide, designed to efficiently radiate electromagnetic waves 

into free space or receive them with minimal reflection and energy loss.
